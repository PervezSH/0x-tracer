# [0x-Tracer](https://0x-tracer.vercel.app/)

[0x-Tracer](https://0x-tracer.vercel.app/) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based address explorer that allows users to easily explore and track information related to Ethereum addresses.

This project was developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to provide a responsive and user-friendly frontend UI.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The frontend UI is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth user experience. Semantic HTML and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) are utilized to create a visually appealing and accessible interface.

- **Address Information**: The explorer integrates with various APIs, including [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/), and [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), to fetch comprehensive details about user addresses. This includes information such as token holdings and their corresponding USD values.

- **Data Visualization**: Data visualization is incorporated using [Recharts](https://recharts.org/), a charting library for React. This enables users to visualize and analyze data related to Ethereum addresses, making it easier to understand patterns and trends.

- **Dynamic Animations**: The user interface is enhanced with dynamic animations using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). These animations bring the interface to life, providing a more engaging and interactive experience for users.

## Technologies Used

The Web3 Address Explorer is built using the following technologies, tools, frameworks, and languages:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and provides a robust development environment for building modern web applications.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience by adding static type checking and improved tooling support.

- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**: A popular CSS framework that provides a responsive grid system and a wide range of pre-built components for building attractive and mobile-friendly user interfaces.

- **[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) API**: [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) API is integrated to fetch Ethereum address details, and transaction history.

- **[Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/) API**: [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/) API is used to retrieve additional information about Ethereum addresses, including token holdings and their corresponding values.

- **[Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) API**: [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) API is utilized to obtain up-to-date USD values for tokens held by Ethereum addresses.

- **[Ether.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)**: [Ether.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) is a JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling seamless execution of EVM transactions within the explorer.

- **[Recharts](https://recharts.org/)**: [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) is a charting library for React that is used to visualize data related to Ethereum addresses, providing clear and informative graphical representations.

- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is a library used to incorporate dynamic animations into the user interface, enhancing the overall experience and making it more engaging for users.
